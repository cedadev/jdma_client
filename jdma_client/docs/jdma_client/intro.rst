Introduction to JDMA
====================

The joint-storage data migration application (JDMA) is a multi-tiered storage
system which provides a single API to users to allow the movement of data to a
number of different storage systems, query the data they have stored on those
storage systems and retrieve the data.  These interactions are carried out using
a common user interface, which is a command line tool to be used interactively,
and a HTTP API to be used programmatically. The command line tool essentially
provides a wrapper for calls to the HTTP API.

JDMA â€‹was designed with the following usability criteria in mind:
  - The user experience for moving data, regardless of the underlying storage systems, should be identical.
  - The user should not be responsible for maintaining the connection to the storage system in the case of asynchronous transfers.
  - The user should receive notifications when the transfers are complete.
  - Users should be able to transfer data from one storage system to another
